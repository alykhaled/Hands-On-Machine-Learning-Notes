    \section{The Curse of Dimensionality}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item The more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of \textbf{overfitting} it.
    	\item One solution to the curse of dimensionality could be to \textbf{increase} the size of the training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances.
    	\item Unfortunately, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows \textbf{exponentially} with the number of dimensions.
    \end{itemize}
    \section{Approaches for Dimensionality Reduction}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item There are two main approaches to reducing dimensionality \textbf{Projection} and \textbf{Manifold}.
